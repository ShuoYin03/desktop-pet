# Assets

This folder stores all art, audio, and generated artefacts for the desktop pet.

## Recommended layout
```
assets/
  textures/
    <pet-id>/
      raw/         # user uploads or reference shots
      processed/   # cleaned frames that the renderer consumes
      spritesheet/ # optional packed atlases generated by tooling
  audio/
    <pet-id>/
      purr/        # looping purring clips
      sfx/         # meows, toy sounds, bowl clinks, etc.
  cache/           # temporary results generated by automation scripts (safe to ignore)
```

Keep human-authored metadata (JSON/YAML) next to the processed assets so the engine can load timing info and hitboxes in the future.

For now, the sample configuration in `apps/desktop/src/preload/sampleConfig.ts` uses inline SVG data URIs as stand-ins for real textures. Replace them with sprite outputs produced by your tooling once ready.
